FastAPI Starter Kit

While I really like the official FastAPI template, I also think that with the integration of things like FastAPI Utils, that there is a lot that can be gained through starting over, and building around class based views instead of the function based views.

Eventually, I'm going to have this be extensive documentation, but right now its just going to be this.
